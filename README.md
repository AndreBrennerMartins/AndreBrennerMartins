- ðŸ‘‹ Pleasure to meet you, I am @AndreBrennerMartins
- Iâ€™m interested in working on things related to entertainment, like programing games
- Programming has always been a thing I was very much into ever since I was ten, so I have been trying to develop on that for quite a long time
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently learning various programs (Mostly java, but I'm very open). I also compose music quite often ðŸŽ¶
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving games, music and anything related, since that's the thing I love making and I think many other people in these industries feel like that, so being a part of a group to make a project whole and real is all I could ever ask :heart:
- If you want to contact me, here is my email: (apologies, for I was not instructed to write my email here)
